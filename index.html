                <p>Web development refers in general to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via
                    intranet or internet. The web development process includes web design, web content development,
                    client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, among other tasks.
                </p>

                <p>Web development is the coding or programming that enables website functionality, per the owner's
                    requirements. It mainly deals with the non-design aspect of building websites, which includes coding
                    and writing markup.

                </p>
                <p>Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex
                    web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.</p>
                <p>Web development is also known as website development, while the professionals that maintain a website
                    are called web developers or (more commonly) web devs.</p>

                <p>So, you’re interested in learning web development and becoming a web developer? First of all,
                    congratulations. You’ve made a great choice.</p>
                <img src="./assets/img/coding.jpg" alt="Coding">
                <h3>Learning Web Development can be hard</h3>
                <p>Start with the end in mind.
                    One of the first things I recommend doing when starting out learning web development is to
                    decide upon a clear end goal, and keep it in mind.</p>
                <img src="./assets/img/frustate.jpg" alt="Frustate Man">
                <p>Whatever your goal, it’s important to understand why you are doing this. This understanding will
                    help you be more productive with your learning time. It will also help encourage you through
                    those times when you feel like giving up.</p>
                <p>Remember, no matter how elaborate and far away the end goal may seem now, you can achieve it with
                    hard work and perseverance.</p>


                <p>Assuming you have no previous experience, it’s a good idea in the beginning to also decide if
                    your interest lies in back end or front end development. Let me briefly explain the difference.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Frontend — this is what the end user see’s and interacts with on the page. Its all the
                            design,
                            fancy effects, layout and imagery that creates the user experience.
                            Generally front end developers will be visual creatives with excellent design skills and
                            a
                            passion for accessibility and user experience. Technologies often associated with front
                            end web
                            development are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Backend — this is the part that typically processes, stores, and manipulates data. It’s
                            how the
                            website or application works. Back-end developers are generally good problem solvers,
                            logical
                            thinkers who are interested in the functionality of a website or application. Back-end
                            development is usually associated with server side languages such as PHP, Python, and
                            Ruby.</p>
                        <p>Either way, wherever your interest lies, I still think that the best place to start is by
                            learning some basic HTML and CSS. After all, it doesn’t matter what area of development
                            that you
                            ultimately want to work in, you still need to be able to display it on a webpage in some
                            kind of
                            mildly presentable form.</p>

                <p>Getting started with the web is a concise series introducing you to the practicalities of web
                    development. You'll set up the tools you need to construct a simple webpage and publish your own
                    simple code.
                </p>
                <p>It's a lot of work to create a professional website, so if you're new to web development, we
                    encourage you to start small. You won't build another Facebook right away, but it's not hard to make
                    your own simple website online, so we'll start there.</p>

                <h2>Installing Basic Software</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>In Installing basic software, we show you what tools you need to do simple web development and how to
                    install them properly.</p>
                <h3>What tools do I actually need, right now?</h3>
                <p>In this article, we'll set you up with the bare minimum — a text editor and some modern web browsers.
                </p>
                <h3>Installing a text editor</h3>
                <p>You probably already have a basic text editor on your computer. By default Windows includes <u><a
                            class="main-links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Notepad"
                            target="_blank">Notepad</a></u> and
                    macOS comes with
                    <u><a class="main-links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit"
                            target="_blank">TextEdit.</a></u>
                    Linux distros vary; Ubuntu comes with <u><a class="main-links"
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit" target="_blank">gedit</a></u>
                    by
                    default.
                </p>
                <p>We recommend starting with <u><a class="main-links" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"
                            target="_blank">Visual
                            Studio Code</a></u>,
                    which is
                    a free editor, that offers live previews and
                    code hints.</p>
                <h3>Installing modern web browsers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="main-links" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"
                            target="_blank">Firefox</a></li>
                    <li><a class="main-links" href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Chrome</a></li>
                    <li><a class="main-links" href="https://www.opera.com/" target="_blank">Opera</a></li>
                    <li><a class="main-links" href="https://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank">Safari</a></li>
                    <li><a class="main-links" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge" target="_blank">Microsoft
                            Edge</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>We recommend to use <a class="main-links" href="https://www.google.com/chrome/"
                        target="_blank">Chrome</a>, because
                    it is very flexible
                    in all platform.</p>
                <h3>What tools do the professionals use?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="mt-20px">A computer. Maybe that sounds obvious to some people, but some of you are

                        on your phone or a library computer. For serious web development, it's better to invest in a

                    modifications such

                <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or
                    between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet
                    and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide
                    Web.</p>
                <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML
                    markup includes special "elements".</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
                    <li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages</li>

                        wrapped in opening
                        and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in

                    language
                    used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as <u><a

                    the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices.</p>
                <p>In short meaning <u><a class="main-links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"
                            target="_blank">CSS</a></u> is use

                    <li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>

                <h3>Why Use CSS?</h3>
                <p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in
                    display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>

                <img class="mt-20px" src="https://www.w3schools.com/css/img_selector.gif" alt="css selector">
                <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.</p>
                <p>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</p>
                <p>Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.</p>
                <p>Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by
                    curly braces.</p>
                <p>In this case our H1 element should be color blue and font-size of 12px.</p>
                <h3>There are 3 ways to link your stylesheets to your HTML files</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inline</li>
                    <li>Internal</li>
                    <li>External</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Out of the 3 given. We recommend to use the External CSS. To manage your code properly.</p>

                <p><u><a class="main-links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"
                            target="_blank">JavaScript</a></u> is a
                    scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every
                    time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at —
                    displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video
                    jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the
                    layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (<u><a class="main-links"
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a></u> and <u><a
                            class="main-links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a></u>) we
                    have covered in much more
                    detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>
                <p><u><a class="main-links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"
                            target="_blank">JavaScript</a></u> is a
                    cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a
                    host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                    environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p><u><a class="main-links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript"
                            target="_blank">JavaScript</a></u> contains
                    a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                        place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and
                        page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                        with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.</li>
                    <li>JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.</li>
                </ul>

                    Sheets. SassScript is the scripting language itself.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sass is a CSS pre-processor.</li>
                    <li>Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time.</li>
                    <li>Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet</li>
                    <li>Sass is an extension to CSS</li>
                    <li>Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS</li>
                    <li>Sass was designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum in 2006</li>
                    <li>Sass is free to download and use</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Why Use Sass?</h3>
                <p>Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a CSS
                    pre-processor can help.</p>

                    lets you use
                    features that do not exist in CSS, like variables, nested rules, mixins, imports,
                    inheritance, built-in functions, and other stuff. </p>

                <p>SCSS contains all the features of CSS and contains more features that are not present in CSS which
                    makes it a good choice for developers to use it. SCSS is full of advanced features. SCSS offers
                    variables, you can shorten your code by using variables. It is a great advantage over conventional
                    CSS.</p>

                <h3>What is GitHub? What is Git? And How to Use These Developer Tools.</h3>
                <p>The first programs you write will probably not be very impressive. You'll make lots of mistakes and
                    you'll never want to revisit the past.</p>
                <p>But soon enough, you'll be writing large, complex programs. Maybe you'll delete some stuff now that
                    you want to bring back later. Or maybe you'll bring in a friend to help, and want to gracefully add
                    their changes to your program while you continue to work on your parts.</p>
                <p>That's where version control comes in, and it's a skill that any employer will expect you to have
                    mastered. It's also extremely useful for anyone working on anything that is saved in pieces - from a
                    computer program to a recipe to a novel.</p>
                <p>The first thing you'll want to do are install git. Click hero to install <u><a
                            href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git</a></u></p>
                <p>Once you've done that, create a <u><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/"
                            target="_blank">Github</a></u>
                    account.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-20px">What is version control?</h3>
                <p>Version control refers to the ability to save your place in a document or folder and reference
                    previous saves.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-20px">What is Git?</h3>
                <p><u><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a></u> is a version control
                    system developed by
                    Linus Torvalds in 2005 (the same guy who wrote Linux).
                    Git helps developers keep track of the state of their code and allows collaboration on a codebase.
                    We'll go over the main components a little later.</p>
                <p><u><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a></u> is a version-control
                    system for tracking
                    changes in computer files and coordinating work on those
                    files among multiple people. Git is a Distributed Version Control System. So Git does not
                    necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project’s files. Instead, every
                    user “clones” a copy of a repository (a collection of files) and has the full history of the project
                    on their own hard drive. This clone has all of the metadata of the original while the original
                    itself is stored on a self-hosted server or a third party hosting service like <u><a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">Github</a></u>.</p>

                    alt="Git">
                <p class="mt-20px">Instead of needing to keep track of every single line of code in your program, it
                    instead notes the
                    changes between the code you have now and the last time you saved. It keeps a running note of when
                    each line of code was saved last, and stores them in a special hidden folder.</p>
                <h3>What is Github?</h3>

                    platform for
                    version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work
                    together on projects from anywhere. This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories,
                    branches, commits, and pull requests.</p>
                <p>GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on
                    software projects. It enables developers to upload their own code files and to collaborate with

                <h3>What is React used for?</h3>
                <p>
                    <u><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)">React</a></u>
                    is an
                    open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces
                    specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile
                    apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</li>
                    <li>React is used to build single-page applications.</li>
                    <li>React allows us to create reusable UI components.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>React is a JavaScript-based UI development library. Facebook and an open-source developer community
                    run it. Although React is a library rather than a language, it is widely used in web development.
                    The library first appeared in May 2013 and is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries
                    for web development.</p>
                <p>React offers various extensions for entire application architectural support, such as Flux and React
                    Native, beyond mere UI.</p>
                <h3 class="mt-20px">Why React?</h3>
                <p>React’s popularity today has eclipsed that of all other front-end development frameworks. Here is
                    why:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy creation of dynamic applications: React makes it easier to create dynamic web applications
                        because it requires less coding and offers more functionality, as opposed to JavaScript, where
                        coding often gets complex very quickly.</li>
                    <li>Improved performance: React uses Virtual DOM, thereby creating web applications faster. Virtual
                        DOM compares the components’ previous states and updates only the items in the Real DOM that
                        were changed, instead of updating all of the components again, as conventional web applications
                        do. </li>
                    <li>Reusable components: Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single
                        app usually consists of multiple components. These components have their logic and controls, and
                        they can be reused throughout the application, which in turn dramatically reduces the
                        application’s development time.</li>
                    <li>Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow. This means that when
                        designing a React app, developers often nest child components within parent components. Since
                        the data flows in a single direction, it becomes easier to debug errors and know where a problem
                        occurs in an application at the moment in question.</li>
                    <li>Small learning curve: React is easy to learn, as it mostly combines basic HTML and JavaScript
                        concepts with some beneficial additions. Still, as is the case with other tools and frameworks,
                        you have to spend some time to get a proper understanding of React’s library.</li>
                    <li>It can be used for the development of both web and mobile apps: We already know that React is
                        used for the development of web applications, but that’s not all it can do. There is a framework
                        called React Native, derived from React itself, that is hugely popular and is used for creating
                        beautiful mobile applications. So, in reality, React can be used for making both web and mobile
                        applications.</li>
                    <li>Dedicated tools for easy debugging: Facebook has released a Chrome extension that can be used to
                        debug React applications. This makes the process of debugging React web applications faster and
                        easier.</li>
                </ul>
